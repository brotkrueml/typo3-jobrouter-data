Module
======

The links to tables in JobRouter installations are managed in the module
:guilabel:`JobRouter` > :guilabel:`Data`.

On your first visit after installing the extension you will see the following
screen:

   Initial Data module screen



.. _usage-create-table-link:

Create a table link
-------------------

To create a new table link, click the :guilabel:`+` button on the top menu bar,
which opens a form. Alternatively, you can use the :guilabel:`Create new table
link` button.


.. _usage-create-table-link-types:

Types
~~~~~

Each table link has one of the following types:

.. _usage-create-table-link-simple:

Simple synchronisation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The data sets of the JobData table are synchronised in a table provided by this
extension. This is the recommended type if you only want to display data,
e.g. with the :ref:`content element <editor-content-element>`. Have a look at
the developer corner to see the :ref:`schema <developer-simple-sync-table>` of
the table and how to use it in your code. The synchronisation is done with the
available :ref:`synchronisation command <sync-command>`.

.. _usage-create-table-link-own:

Synchronisation in own table
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You have to define a table yourself in an extension with the needed columns
from the JobData table. This is the recommended way when you want to display the
data yourself, e.g. with filtering by some columns or with joins to other data.
The synchronisation is carried out with the available :ref:`synchronisation
command <sync-command>`.

.. _usage-create-table-link-other:

Other usage (no synchronisation)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You only define the link to a JobData table â€“ there is no automatic
synchronisation. This type can be used for the TYPO3 JobRouter Form extension to
push the field values of a submitted form into a JobData table. Also you can
synchronise data sets yourself and enrich the data with additional information.

.. _usage-table-links-overview:

Table links overview
--------------------

After you have created one or more table links, you will see an overview of the
table links when you open the module:

.. figure:: _images/table-links-overview.png
   :alt: Overview of available table links

   Overview of available table links

If a table link is not enabled, this is indicated by the addition "(disabled)"
in the name.

There are three buttons available for each table link:

.. image:: _images/table-link-buttons.png

- You can edit a table link with the pencil. Alternatively click on the name of
  the table to open the edit form.
- Click on the bug icon to test a table link connection.
- The last icon is a link to the JobData table definition in the JobRouter
  installation. Alternatively click on the table GUID to open the JobData table
  definition.

The table link records are stored under the root page. You can edit a table link
also inside the :guilabel:`List` module.

.. _usage-delete-table:

Delete a table link
-------------------

To delete a table link, open the edit page of the table link. In the upper
menu bar you will find the :guilabel:`delete` button.


.. _usage-report:

Report
======

.. note::

   The report is only available if you install and activate the Reports
   system extension.

A report is available to give an overview about the number of table links and
potential errors. You find it under :guilabel:`System` > :guilabel:`Reports` >
:guilabel:`JobRouter Data`. Alternatively, click in the :guilabel:`JobRouter` >
:guilabel:`Data` module on the |report-module-icon| :guilabel:`Report` icon in the top menu bar.

Synchronisations
----------------

Some statistics about the number of different table link types are shown.
If errors occurred during the last synchronisation run, these are displayed.
The message is abbreviated, move the mouse over it to see it in full.


Transfers
---------

You can see some figures on the current state of transfers: How many have been
created, how many were successful, how many are currently queued and will be
transmitted on the next run, and how many erroneous transfers. If there are
transfers with errors, you can find the cause in the :ref:`logs
<configuration-extension>`.
