Introduction
============

`JobRouter <https://www.jobrouter.com/>`_ is a scalable digitisation platform
which links processes, data and documents. The TYPO3 extension `TYPO3 JobRouter
Data <https://github.com/brotkrueml/typo3-jobrouter-data>`_ synchronises tables
from JobRouter installations into TYPO3.

.. admonition:: Work In Progress

   Currently, the TYPO3 JobRouter Data extension is in a development phase. As
   it can be used already, the API is still subject to change.


What does it do?
================

The TYPO3 JobRouter Data is a TYPO3 extension for synchronising
`JobData <https://www.jobrouter.com/en/jobdata/>`_ tables into TYPO3. A plugin
is available to display these data on a web page.

This extension uses the :doc:`JobRouter Client <client:introduction>`
library and has the
`TYPO3 JobRouter Connector <https://github.com/brotkrueml/typo3-jobrouter-connector>`_
extension as a requirement to define connections to JobRouter installations.
